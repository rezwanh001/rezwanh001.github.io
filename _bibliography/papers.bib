  abstract={Blood components such as hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine are essential for monitoring one's health condition. The current blood component measurement approaches still depend on invasive techniques that are painful and uncomfortable for patients. To facilitate measurement at home, we proposed a novel non-invasive technique to measure blood hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine levels based on Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Fingertip videos from 93 subjects have been collected using a smartphone. The PPG signal is generated from each video, and 46 characteristic features are then extracted from the PPG signal, its derivatives (1st and 2nd), and from Fourier analysis. Additionally, age and gender are also included as features due to their significant effects on hemoglobin, glucose, and creatinine. A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) using genetic algorithms (GA) has been used to select the optimal features to avoid redundancy and overfitting. Finally, DNN-based models have been developed to estimate the blood Hemoglobin (Hb), Glucose (Gl), and Creatinine (Cr) levels from the selected features. The approach provides the best-estimated accuracy of R² = 0.922 for Hb, R² = 0.902 for Gl, and R² = 0.969 for Cr. Experimental results show that the proposed method is a suitable technique to be used clinically to measure human blood component levels without taking blood samples. This paper also reveals that smartphone-based PPG signals have great potential to measure different blood components.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
