I am delighted to share that our team's work on sign language recognition technology has been featured by the **University of Waterloo's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering**.

This recognition follows our recent success at the **IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)**, where our research was honored with the **Best Poster Award** and secured **2nd Place** in the SignEval Challenge.

The university's feature article, titled "Cutting-edge research in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is making global waves in sign language technology," highlights our commitment to advancing inclusive technology.
