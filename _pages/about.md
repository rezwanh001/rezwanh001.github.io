I am an MASc student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), Canada, working under the supervision of [Prof. Fakhri Karray](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/karray). As a researcher at the [Centre for Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (CPAMI)](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-pattern-analysis-machine-intelligence/) Lab, my work primarily focuses on Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) and Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I have a strong publication record in top-tier conferences and journals (ICCV, IJCNN, SMC, IEEE Access, Springer, Elsevier, etc.), and professional experience as a Machine Learning Engineer and Consultant. My research interests span AI, Deep Learning, Multimodal AI Agents, and Human-Centered Machine Intelligence.
