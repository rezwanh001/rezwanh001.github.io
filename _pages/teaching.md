### Spring 2025- **ECE 252: Systems Programming and Concurrency**.

- Term: Spring 2025 (Teaching Assistant (TA))

#### [Course Description](https://uwflow.com/course/ECE252)
##### This course covers the following topics:
- Processes and threads (pthreads)
- System calls
- Concurrency (semaphore, mutex, monitors, and barrier synchronization)
- User-level memory management
- Performance and correctness of concurrent systems
- Deadlock detection and recovery
- File systems

**Prerequisites**:  
- ECE 250; Level at least 2B in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering.
- This course requires substantial programming skill. The basics of the C language will be reviewed briefly, and should be familiar to anyone who has already used C++.

**Antirequisites**:  
- CS 343, CS 350, ECE 254, SE 350

#### Readings

##### Main Textbook
- W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago: _Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment_, 3rd edition, Addison-Wesley, 2013. ISBN: 978-0-321-63773-4.

##### Optional Reference
- Michael Kerrisk: _The Linux Programming Interface_, No Starch Press, 2010. ISBN: 978-1-59327-220-3.

#### Evaluation
Coursework will include the following components:
- **Assignments (10%)**
- **Lab projects (40%)**
- **Final exam (50%)**

##### Assignments
###### There are three equally weighted programming assignments, for a total of 10%. Assignment grading is based on the following scale:
- **0**: Not attempted or does not work at all
- **1**: There are some issues
- **2**: Everything works as expected

##### Lab Projects
- There are five lab projects. The grading policies are specified in the lab manual (available on LEARN).

#### Course Objectives

##### Students who successfully complete the **lecture component** will be able to:
- Invoke (apply) system calls, from the view of an application programmer, to access resources like files, inter-process communication mechanisms, and the network.
- Analyze, design, implement, and debug concurrent C programs using concurrency control constructs (such as a mutex or semaphore).
- Apply standard concurrency scenarios such as producer-consumer, readers-writers, and dining philosophers, as well as deadlock and starvation.

##### Students who successfully complete the **lab component** will be able to:
- Interact with the Linux operating system through the command-line interface and the C language API.
- Read the documentation of, understand, and interact with available libraries, such as those for multi-threading, file handling, and network operations.
- Use inter-process communication mechanisms such as shared memory.
- Identify, analyze, and solve concurrency and synchronization problems.

#### Acknowledgment
- Lecture materials, assignments, and portions of this course outline were provided by [Prof. Andrew Morton](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/profile/arrmorto).

### Winter 2025- **ECE 459: Programming for Performance**.

- Term: Winter 2025 (Teaching Assistant (TA))

#### [Course Description](https://uwflow.com/course/ECE459)
##### This course covers the following topics [(Course Resources)](https://github.com/jzarnett/ece459):
- Profiling computer systems
- bottlenecks, Amdahl's law
- Techniques for programming multicore processors
- cache consistency
- Transactional memory. Streaming architectures, vectorization, and SIMD
- High-performance programming languages

**Prerequisites**:  
- ECE 254 or 354 or SE 350; Level at least 4A Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering or Software Engineering

#### Readings

##### Textbook
- There are detailed notes. There's no required textbook for the course. The notes cite a number of sources, some of which are useful books. But there's no single source that does it all, so it would be silly to ask you to buy one.

#### Evaluation
##### Coursework will include the following components:
- **Academic Integrity Exercise (1%)**
- **Assignments (64%)   (4 at 16% each)**
- **Final exam (35%)**

#### Acknowledgment
- Lecture materials, assignments, and portions of this course outline were provided by [Prof. Jeff Zarnett](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/contacts/jeff-zarnett).
